Abstract: Despite women being over half of the world’s population, they are severely underrepresented in the governments of the world, leading to concerns that women’s issues may not be fully considered. As a result, many governments have passed gender quotas mandating higher representation of women in their legislatures. However, does this actually affect policy outcomes or just increase women’s representation? This paper seeks to understand the connection between women’s representation and outcomes by studying Argentina’s representation and one historically feminized issue, infant mortality, at the provincial level. Does increased women’s representation from gender quotas result in lower levels of infant mortality in the Argentinian provinces? I find that quotas do affect women’s representation, but the link between women’s representation and infant mortality does not hold.
